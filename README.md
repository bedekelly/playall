PlayAll
=======

###A wrapper for tmsu and mplayer which allows creating playlists based on tag combinations. 

Requirements:
  (+) tmsu (with tags to use)
  (+) mplayer
  
IMPORTANT:
  To use this script, you'll have to ctrl+f for "bede" and replace it with your username.
  For reasons I can't possibly begin to understand, using the ~ contraction just doesn't cut it.
  

Usage:
    pla yall [tag]...
  
    playall [tag=value]...
  
    playall --shuffle [tag | tag=value]...
  
    playall --search <"search term"> [tag | tag=value]...
  
  
--shuffle shuffles the files before being written to playlist. This is so that although the order is random, skipping forwards and backwards in mplayer does not disrupt the order.

--search allows for files which match a search term to be played first. If more than one file matches the search term, they will be added in the correct order (i.e. still in correct album order).#

For help using mplayer, use 'man mplayer'.
For help using tmsu, use 'tmsu help' or see tmsu.org.
